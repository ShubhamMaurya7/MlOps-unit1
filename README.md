# Git Workflow Implemented

## The following Git operations were performed:
1) Initial repository creation.

2) Initial commit with dataset loading script.

3) Creation of a new branch experiment-v1.

4) Addition of missing value analysis.

5) Merging experiment-v1 branch back into main.

6) This workflow reflects a standard experimentation cycle in MLOps.
