# Git Workflow Implemented

The following Git operations were performed:

Initial repository creation.

Initial commit with dataset loading script.

Creation of a new branch experiment-v1.

Addition of missing value analysis.

Merging experiment-v1 branch back into main.

This workflow reflects a standard experimentation cycle in MLOps.
